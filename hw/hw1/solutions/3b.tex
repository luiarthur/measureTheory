Here is a counter example where axiom 3 for a $\sigmaField$ does not hold.

Suppose that $\Omega=[0,4]$, $A=[0,2]$, $B=[1, 3]$. And $A,B \in \F$.

Then, $A\cup B = [0,3]$.

Note also that $A \cup B = [0,3]$,  $A^c = (2,4]$, $B^c = [0,1) \cup (3,4]$,
$A \cup B^c = [0,2] \cup (3,4]$, $A^c \cup B = [1,4]$, 
and $A^c \cup B^c = [0,1) \cup (2,4]$. But $A\cup B$ is not included.

In this case, $A,B \in \F$ but $A\cup B \notin \F$.
